# TAZ: Beaureau of Balance dice roller

Code is modified from Teals' 3D dice roller. This is meant to be used when playing The Adventure Zone: Bureau of Balance game online. The game uses a modified d20, where the numbers only go from 1-6, with an automatic fail side and an automatic win side. 

Future updates might include dice of different colors, or a tracker to keep track of the added number (much like the game board).
